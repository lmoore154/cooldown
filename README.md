### Thanks for taking the coding challenge!

**Setup**

You will need the lastest versions of the following installed:
- Node
- Yarn
- At least v2.3.3 of Ruby

If you're missing something from this list, the easiest way to get these things is through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

--------------

## Getting Started

- Fork the repo
- Start up a `rails server`
- `cd cooldown-react`
- Start up an npm server with `npm start`
- Don't forget to `bundle install`, `yarn install`, and `db:create`/`db:migrate` -- this app was made with a Postgres DB
- Open a browser to localhost:3001
- Voila! You're there!
